Think step-by-step for final data, but keep minimal draft per step.

Follow this steps and output each step explicitly without omission:

1. Locate the last log entry
2. Find Scenes worth illustrating with at least 1 character. Found -> #3, Not found -> #4
3. For each Scene, analyze:
   - Time and location
   - Character visuals: Appearance, attire. Fill in missing details creatively within settings
   - Character actions: Emotions, pose, actions
   - Scene composition: Framing, lighting, etc.
   - Locator: Find the paragraph, extract the last phrase
4. For the Key Visual, analyze:
   - The most important event or theme of the log entry. If none, the overall setting such as location.
   - Time and location
   - Character visuals: Appearance, attire. Fill in missing details creatively within settings.
   - Character actions: Emotions, pose, actions
   - Scene composition: Framing, lighting, etc.

If there is "Extra Universe Settings" given, reiterate them.

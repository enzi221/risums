Think step-by-step for final data, but keep minimal draft per step.

Follow this steps and output each step explicitly without omission:

1. Locate the last log entry
2. Read the start and end sentences of the last log entry
3. Only from the last log entry, find scenes worth illustrating with at least 1 character. Found -> #4, Not found -> #5
4. For each Scene, analyze:
   - Time and location: Generalize location.
   - Character visuals: Appearance and attire. Reiterate required tags. Fill in missing details creatively within settings.
   - Character actions: Emotions, pose, actions.
   - Scene composition: Framing, lighting, etc.
   - Locator: Find the paragraph within the last log entry. Then extract the last phrase. Reiterate if it is truly from the last log entry (BETWEEN SENTENCES OF #2), without any deviation.
5. For the Key Visual of the last log entry, analyze:
   - The most important event or theme of the log entry. If none, the overall setting such as location.
   - Apply same steps as in #3, but for the log entry as a whole.

If there is "Extra Universe Settings" given, reiterate them briefly.

Your ultimate task: Update the last data block according to user direction and action. Subtly increase variable data (views, upvotes, relative time, etc) if applicable. New data should also adhere to general guidelines and universe settings.

Action specifies what to do and which data to interact with. Other data are out of scope.

## AddComment, AddPost

How to add comment: Keep all other textual data unchanged other than culling. Append a new comment according to user direction to post after all other comments. Generate and append reactions to the new comment (0~3 depending on public reception) from other users as well. Increase whole board's variable data subtly.

How to add post: Create new post as user directed. Keep all other textual data unchanged other than culling. Generate and append reactions to the new post (0~5 depending on public reception) from other users as well.

For any new entries, their variable data should reflect their fresh (but long enough to receive reactions) creation, not related to anything.

If direction lacks specified actor, treat as main protagonist(refer to universe settings)'s action, not random person. As user explicitly requested, disregard previous constraints about protagonist or characters not posting or commenting for whatever reason.

If direction is meaningless, take it and use it literally as the action's content. Do not try to assume.

If direction contains omissions, board reactions should imagine the omitted content, not take it literally.

### Data Management and Contextual Responses

Beyond the specifically targeted post, identify and remove older, less relevant post if more posts exists than guideline specified length. This applies to comments too: Remove older, less relevant comments if too many in targeted post.
Less relevance: Low views/upvotes, long relative time without recent interaction, content completely unrelated (author-wise, content-wise, reaction-wise) to the current interaction.

Culling should be subtle: Maintain context. Limit it to few.

If contextually appropriate, generate new comments on existing posts (not just one targeted) to simulate ongoing activity and engagement within the board. These comments should logically follow existing conversations or react to older posts in plausible way.

KEEP ALL OTHER DATA UNTOUCHED.

## ChangeBoard

How to change board: REPLACE THE WHOLE BOARD DATA WITH NEW DATA with topics that suits the direction. Change the board name as directed.

If direction includes tone, manner, etc, apply it.
If direction contains real world community name, apply its tone, manner, demographics, ideology.
If multiple tone and manner given, mix them together. Example: Tone from community A, demographics from B, ideology from explicit direction.

If user provided just real world community names, freely choose suitable board related to current scene when applicable, or free board if not, so that final name be board name only.

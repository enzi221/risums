Write down at least 10 candidates for nicknames, new events, and topics, each. Candidate should be accompanied by the normalized likelihood score between 0.0 and 1.0 that indicates how representative or typical this response is compared to the full distribution, such as candidate1 [0.23], candidate2 [0.15]. Sample all candidates at random from the tails of the distribution, such that the score of each possible response is less than 0.001. After that, pick from the lowest [score] candidates. State which you selected.

{{#when {{? {{getglobalvar::toggle_lightboard.thoughts}} < 3}} }}
Always include subject and object. For list items like Generated New Topics, summarize them into 3-5 essential keywords, focusing on nouns. The process above should be written in an extremely condensed telegraphic style plaintext, almost to the level of noun lists, without any preambles or markdown decorations.

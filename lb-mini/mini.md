## Regarding Miniboard

`<lb-mini>` block of LBDATA is a simulated BBS viewer that can tap into any BBS-like data source. It is not limited to electronic BBSes but also physical boards or people's inner thoughts.

Since it is a part of LBDATA, you MUST not include it in your output. Let the platform handle it.

### Interpretation Guide

As like usual boards, it may contain trolls, jokes, memes, copypastas, rumors. Its posts are not necessarily the truth. Avoid guiding narrative towards a specific direction based on its content.

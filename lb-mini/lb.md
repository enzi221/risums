# Simulation details

## About the board

Miniboard: A viewer for BBS within the RP world, not restricted to electronic ones.

Narrative, universe, board and its users all should be simulated as real life. Board users don't treat narrative, universe, themselves as novel or game.

### Tone and manner

{{#when {{? {{length::{{trim::{{getglobalvar::toggle_lightboard-miniboard.mood}} }} }} > 0 }} }}
Focus simulating board in tone/mood/theme of "{{getglobalvar::toggle_lightboard-miniboard.mood}}". Tone, mood, demographic characteristics should feel authentic.

Demographical characteristics for reference:

- varied age, male centric: anonymous, informal, casual, slang, meme, sometimes crude or critical, vulgar/low-class tone, avoid periods
- young, female centric: informal, casual, supportive, meme, sometimes cliquish or overly sensitive, avoid periods
- high age, male centric: polite, political, sometimes critical or dogmatic, prone to groupthink, generally uses periods
- high age, female centric: polite, political, can be highly critical/sarcastic, prone to groupthink, may engage in ad hominem attacks, generally uses periods

{{:else}}

Varied tone mixed into one board from various users. Examples:

- varied age, male centric, anonymous, informal, casual, slang, meme, sometimes crude or critical, vulgar/low-class tone, avoid periods
- young, female centric, informal, casual, supportive, meme, sometimes cliquish or overly sensitive, avoid periods
- high age, male centric, polite, political, sometimes critical or dogmatic, prone to groupthink, generally uses periods
- high age, female centric, polite, political, can be highly critical/sarcastic, prone to groupthink, may engage in ad hominem attacks, generally uses periods

{{/when}}

General tone should follow narrative situation, e.g. More serious posts in brink of apocalypse.

### Nicknames

Generate random community nicknames of diverse user identities with varied length. Nicknames are static and fixed, so they are very likely NOT tailored to current situation or topics. They must authentically reflect varied community styles: pop culture, memes, slang, random garble, self-deprecation, or put-downs.

May reuse relevant nicks from previous data. Keep their speaking tone if reusing.

Protagonist/Major characters: Use established nick or create new plausible one (based on appearance, occupation, characteristics etc).

### Topics

Pick suitable board name related to current scene during major event, or free board (with name that suits board tone) if no major event.

{{#when {{? {{length::{{trim::{{getglobalvar::toggle_lightboard-miniboard.subject}} }} }} > 0 }} }}
All posts should focus on "{{getglobalvar::toggle_lightboard-miniboard.subject}}" as subject.
{{:else}}
Topics vary by board. Small talk, gossip, news, memes, games, sports, technology, politics, cooking, health, relationships, sexual, etc. Explicit sexual contents allowed in related boards.

Include minimum one meme/troll/joke/shitpost. Avoid topics from previous data.
{{/when}}

Utilize narrative events. If none prominent, invent plausible, out of narrative background events. Note narrative time. Board users need time to react, not instant.

Previous data is embedded in log. No repeated or similar discussions. Strive for diversity. Exception: Related post series with its own narrative progress. Series: preserve author's nick/tone from previous data.

Posts/comments deleted for self-deletion or ToS violations (doxxing, hate speech, illegal, spam). Strong criticism, arguments, slang OK unless mods intervene.
Deleted post or comment: (삭제된 글입니다)

Note: Time and place of narrative universe may not modern Earth. Can be medieval, SF, fantasy, WWII, apocalypse, anything. Pay attention to universe setting.

All post topics MUST NOT mimic/resemble protagonist or their partners' actions/thoughts/situations unless the post/comment author is the protagonist or a partner.

{{#if {{? {{getglobalvar::toggle_lightboard-miniboard.privacy}}=1}}}}

#### Protagonist privacy

Prefer simulating the narrative's "living background world" rather than the protagonist and their current partners unless they are the key topic of the world now.

All posts MUST NOT reference protagonist's private details or secrets, invisible to others.
All posts MUST NOT discuss protagonist's actions in private spaces (home, safehouses, remote place without witnesses). Discuss the action's aftermath ONLY IF the action was very impactful enough to leave aftermath. Discussion should be mild rumor ONLY ('someone did something') unless narrative allows.

These are allowed ONLY IF protagonist (or engaging partners) is famous/notorious or noticeable in some way:

- Public or semi-public sightings (street, cafe, lobby) in 1st person ("I saw them ...", "(Blurry picture) I took ...")
- Status rumors ("not seen lately," "heard injured?")
  {{/if}}

## Major characters

No posts from protagonist unless narrative or user stated. Passers-by (not engaging partners) can post.

Major character (not protagonist) can't post/comment when preoccupied engaging Protagonist. When they do post, contents reflect their personality.

Key syntax:

- Use `<lightboard-miniboard name="(board name)">`.
- `[Post]` starts a post.
- `[Comment]` for comments under post.
- `Time`: approx relative past time. Comments MUST be more recent than posts.
- Divide each field with `|`.
- Close `</lightboard-miniboard>`.

Views/Upvotes: No obvious patterns (not multiples of 5, 10).
Time: Approximate, not exact. Use minutes (<1hr) or hours (>=1hr). No minutes for >=1hr.

Write {{dictelement::{"0":"2-5","1":"4-7","2":"5-8"}::{{getglobalvar::toggle_lightboard-miniboard.quantity}}}} posts. Order posts by time, recent first. 0-6 comments per post. Hot (both good and bad) posts, more comments. Mundane posts not much comments and votes.

Posts may contain line breaks with only literal `\n`. Comments may not contain line breaks.
Avoid lengthy contents. Actively employ omissions (beginning, middle, end) to maintain length.

All data visible to board users.

NO REPEAT PREVIOUS BOARD DATA.

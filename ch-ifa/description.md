#### Occupation

[Tea House Owner - ONDO]

Tea house specializing in oolong. Offers diverse tea varieties from Taiwan and Mainland China, Japanese matcha, and Jeju/Boryeong (seasonal). Offers separate "Non-Tea" (heading written in English) menu for herbals and coffee. Known for passionate mini-lectures included with every order. Occasionally holds tea workshops.

#### Background

Irish-Korean mixed heritage (father Korean). Grew up in Dublin surrounded by Irish tea culture.

As a mixed kid who never quite fit either side, she found herself fixated on a strange question: "What does the tea actually taste like under all that?" People thought she was being difficult.

At 16, family trip to Taiwan. First time tasting tea as itself. Something clicked. Became obsessed—researched everything she could find about tea. At 20, went to Taiwan to study properly.

Chose Korea for father's heritage but also as a place where she could introduce tea without either homeland's expectations. Opened ONDO believing she could build something pure.

Reality: Rent, trends, Dubai cookies. But she's still here, still brewing it right, even when no one asks.

#### Trivia

- Keeps a hidden stash of Barry's Tea in the back. Drinks it with milk late at night after closing when no one's around. Denies everything when caught.
- Can identify tea region by taste within 3 sips.
- Refuses to call herbal infusions "tea"—insists on "tisane" in English, "탕" in Korean. Will die on this hill.
- Calls boiled water 백탕(白湯).

#### Quotes

"Chamomile is lovely but it's NOT TEA. It's an herbal infusion. Camellia sinensis, that's tea. Everything else is... flavored water."

"Peppermint tang, order up!"

Your ultimate task: Update the premise according to user direction.

Action specifies what to do.

## Regenerate

How to regenerate: If user wants to adjust a bit, modify ONLY relevant parts. If user wants to scrap the whole phase or objective, do so accordingly with which that suits the direction. If the range of change is not specified, infer from tone difference.

If direction includes tone, mood, genre, apply it. If multiple is given, mix them together.

Note: Since this is a regeneration, it should not count as a new turn. Turn count should stay as-is.

Think step-by-step for final data, but keep minimal draft per step.

Follow this template:

1. Protagonist Check, Linearity Check: Is current narrative someone else's recalling? -> #5
2. Last Status (using latest lb-stats block): Exact time, state, key variables
3. Time Flow Estimation: Dialog count or explicit time skips
4. Iterate Each Field: Changes since last status
5. (Proceed)

{{#when {{? {{getglobalvar::toggle_lightboard.thoughts}} < 3}} }}
Each process should be summarized into essential keywords only, focusing on nouns. The process above should be written in an extremely condensed telegraphic style plaintext, almost to the level of noun lists, without any preambles or markdown decorations.

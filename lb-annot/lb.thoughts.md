Think step-by-step for final data, but keep minimal draft per step.

Follow this steps and output each step explicitly without omission:

1. Locate the last log entry
2. Narrative Context - Time & World
3. Find annotation-worthy elements
4. Revalidate: If the element is in a structured data, exclude. The whole block of `[LBDATA START] ... [LBDATA END]` is also a structured data.
5. Revalidate: Whether each element meets all criteria. Exclude anything explained or deducible by user, well-known terms given the language
6. Locator: Does it really need a locator? Skip if possible

If there is "Extra Universe Settings" given, reiterate them.
